# ArtifactsMMO Client - Refactoring Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Iron Dagger Crafting Script
- Created `iron-dagger-crafting-loop.js` - A script for crafting iron daggers with quantity parameter
- Implemented material calculation (6 iron, 2 feathers per dagger)
- Added proper error handling and cooldown management
- Made crafting quantity configurable via command line argument

### 2. GUI Refactoring
- Split monolithic `index.html` into modular components:
  - CSS: Separated into main.css, tabs.css, processes.css, skills.css
  - JavaScript: Organized into module-specific files in `public/js/modules/`
  - HTML: Created cleaner, more maintainable structure

### 3. JavaScript Modularization
- Created module structure:
  - `tabs.js`: Tab navigation functionality
  - `characters.js`: Character management and data fetching
  - `processes.js`: Process control and monitoring
  - `skills.js`: Skills tab functionality
  - `skill.js`: Skill level calculations and color coding
  - `tasks.js`: Task execution functions
  - `main.js`: Application initialization

### 4. Character Skills Tab
- Added a new Skills tab to display character skill levels
- Implemented color coding based on skill level values (1-40)
- Created legend with color gradient for reference
- Added table view with all character skills

### 5. Iron Dagger Crafting UI
- Added iron dagger card to the Gear tab
- Implemented quantity selector (1, 5, 10, 20 daggers)
- Created character dropdown integration

### 6. GUI Improvements
- Standardized character dropdown population with data-character-dropdown attribute
- Improved tab switching with backward compatibility
- Enhanced error handling for API responses
- Added notification system for user feedback

### 7. API Endpoints
- Added character details endpoint in gui.js
- Improved error handling for API responses
- Added support for both new and legacy API response formats

## Next Steps for Development

### 1. Testing
- Follow the TEST-PLAN.md document to validate all functionality
- Test all resource cards and forms
- Verify backward compatibility with existing scripts

### 2. Further Refactoring Opportunities
- Complete modularization of the remaining inline JavaScript functions
- Create separate CSS files for each tab's specific styles
- Implement a module loader system for better dependency management
- Consider implementing a more robust form validation system

### 3. Feature Enhancements
- Add support for additional crafting recipes
- Enhance process monitoring with statistics and graphs
- Implement character inventory viewer
- Add configuration UI for script parameters

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all modules and functions
- Implement unit tests for critical functions
- Create an automated build process
- Standardize error handling across all modules

### 5. User Experience Improvements
- Add loading indicators for API operations
- Implement persistent user preferences
- Enhance accessibility of the UI
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Architecture Overview

The refactored application follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns:

1. **Core Modules**:
   - `tabs.js`: Manages tab navigation and content display
   - `characters.js`: Handles character data and selection
   - `processes.js`: Manages script execution and monitoring
   - `skills.js`: Displays character skill information
   - `tasks.js`: Executes specific game tasks

2. **Communication Flow**:
   - Client-side JavaScript modules make requests to local Express API endpoints
   - Express server proxies requests to the game API and handles process management
   - Process execution is managed via Node.js child processes

3. **State Management**:
   - Character data is cached in memory for dropdowns
   - Process state is maintained on the server and polled by the client
   - Tab state is managed in the browser

## Conclusion

The refactoring has significantly improved code organization, maintainability, and extensibility. The modular structure makes it easier to add new features and fix bugs, while the improved UI provides better user experience.
